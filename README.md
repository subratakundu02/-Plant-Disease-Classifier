The Tree Disease Classifier is a machine learning project aimed at identifying diseases in trees using image recognition techniques. This project employs deep learning algorithms to classify images of tree leaves and diagnose potential diseases accurately.

Features
Image Classification: Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification.
Multiple Classes: Can differentiate between various types of tree diseases.
Easy to Use: Provides a simple interface for users to upload images and obtain disease predictions.

Usage
Upload an image of a tree leaf.
Click on the "Classify" button.
Wait for the model to process the image.
View the predicted disease along with confidence scores.
Dataset
The model was trained on a dataset consisting of thousands of images of healthy and diseased tree leaves. The dataset covers a variety of tree species and diseases, ensuring robustness and accuracy in classification.

Model
The classification model is based on a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, fine-tuned on the specific tree disease dataset. The model achieves high accuracy and generalization on unseen data.
